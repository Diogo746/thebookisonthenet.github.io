On January 7, 1958, President Eisenhower announced ARPA, a new organization responsible for all government high-technology work. Soon, ARPA was spending millions on research in science and technology. In remote laboratories, brilliant scientists explored extraordinary ideas, such as developing bombs that could spread diseases and planning for wars in space. ARPA's initial projects aimed to win the space race sparked by Sputnik, but these were soon placed under NASA's control. NASA captured public imagination throughout the 1960s, especially after President Kennedy announced plans to land a man on the moon. While NASA attracted media attention, ARPA focused on a project that would prove even more significant: computing. In 1966, Bob Taylor was in charge of ARPA's computer projects. With a background in brain research, he recognized that computers were not just machines for calculations; they could also communicate. At that time, computers were rare and expensive, comparable to luxury cars, primarily used by universities, governments, and large companies for mathematical tasks.

When Bob Taylor had the money for a network, he began to hire people to build it. His first choice for a manager of the project was Larry Roberts. Roberts was perfect for the job because he was an expert in both computers and communications. He had just succeeded in linking two computers on opposite coasts of the USA. Bob Taylor had paid for this work and now he wanted Larry Roberts to go to work at ARPA. The problem was that Roberts did not want to come. He was happy where he was - Lincoln Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

So Charlie Herzfeld called Roberts's boss at Lincol. The boss of Lincoln Laboratory quickly called him into his office... Two weeks later Larry Roberts was at ARPA.

Bob Taylor gave Larry Roberts the job of finding computers for the new network. ARPA wanted to use some of the computers that it paid for at universities around the USA. But the people who controlled these machines were not enthusiastic.

So ARPA got the computers for its network, which Taylor had decided to call the ARPAnet. But it was 1966 and no one in the world really knew how to build a network. Larry Roberts began to make plans. He had the money and he had permission to join together four big computers. But the really important questions about the design of the network had no answers yet.

Bob Taylor held a conference for ARPA's computer researchers at Ann Arbor, Michigan, in early 1967. This was Larry Roberts's chance to describe his plans and hear the opinions of the best computer scientists in the USA. At first they were not enthusiastic.

Roberts said that he planned to join the computers together directly, with telephone lines. This meant that the 'host' computers would do two jobs: the work they already did, and the extra work of controlling the new network. Most of the audience hated this idea.

When Larry Roberts got back to Washington, he wrote a new plan for the ARPAnet, including Wes Clark's ideas. He called the new, smaller computers 'IMPs'. These IMPs would be the interface between the different host computers. In other words, they would allow two systems to meet and talk to each other.

The design of the ARPAnet was becoming clearer. But Larry Roberts still didn't know exactly how the IMPs should speak to each other. Roberts explained his latest ideas at another conference. This meeting was held at Catlinburg, Tennessee, at the end of 1967. Roberts talked about the ARPAnet, the host computers, and the inner network of IMPs that would help the hosts to communicate. But he did not say much about how this communication would work. That was still not clear.

At the same meeting there was another talk by Roger Scantlebury, from the National Physical Laboratory in England. He spoke about how to build a 'packet-switched' network. To Larry Roberts, packet switching sounded perfect tor the ARPAnet.

Packet switching is a very efficient way to send data electronically. Each message is broken down into pieces or 'packets'. The packets are then sent out into the communications network. There is no need for the packets to travel together or in any particular order. Each packet is free to find the best route to its destination. When all the packets have arrived, they are put back together again to form the original message.

There is nearly always more than one route to any destination through a network. If there are ten routes from A to B, it will he quicker to break a message into ten parts and send them all at the same time than to send the whole message along a single path.

Packet switching also takes advantage of the fact that the data used by nearly all computers is 'digital'. This means that the original information - sounds or pictures, for example - is translated into a system of numbers. Digital information is very easy to copy. It can easily be broken down into packets and put back together again without losing any data.

Vint Cerf is an engineer who has written some of the most important software for today's Internet. He said that digital packets are just like postcards: 'The best way to describe packet-switching technology is to remind you that packets are just like postcards. They've got "to" and "from" addresses on them and they've got a limited amount of content. And, like a postcard, you put them in the post box. If you put two in, you do not know what order they're going to come out in. They might not even come out on the same day. They do not necessarily follow the same paths to get to the destination. The only difference is that an electronic packet goes about a hundred million times faster than a postcard.'

Now Larry Roberts had plans for the hardware and the software of the ARPAnet. The next question was, who could build it? This was exactly what Larry Roberts asked Wes Clark when Clark gave him the idea for a network of IMPs. There's only one person in America who can build that network: Frank Heart.

Larry Roberts knew Frank Heart. They had worked together at Lincoln Laboratory. Heart was an expert in 'real-time systems' - systems that work so quickly that human beings do not notice any delay at all. The ARPAnet did not need to be so fast. But to make packet switching work, lots of very complicated problems of tuning would have to be solved. Frank Heart's skills seemed to make him the best man for the job. He was also known as someone who always finished what he started.

But Larry Roberts could not simply hire him. Contracts like the ARPAnet were supposed to be offered to many competitors so the government got the best deal. Roberts had to ask for bids from the best companies in the computer and communications industries. In August 1968, he wrote a plan and sent it to 140 technology companies.

The biggest names in the computer business at the time were sure that the network could not be built. Both IBM (International Business Machines) and Control Data Corporation said the job was impossible. They said no one could build the network for an acceptable price because the IMPs would have to be enormously expensive mainframe computers.

The telephone companies were even more negative. AT and T controlled long-distance phone calls in the USA. 'You'll never make packet switching work,' it said. They had never been helpful to computer scientists... So the computer scientists went away - and they created the Internet.

One of the companies that bid to build the ARPAnet was Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. BBN was the place where Frank Heart worked, and half the staff had already worked with Larry Roberts at Lincoln Laboratory.Frank Heart gave ARPA's plan to his best programmer, Severo Ornstein.

Frank Heart believed that a small company had an advantage in this situation. Unlike IBM or AT and T, BBN could move very quickly. For four weeks Heart and his team worked day and night. Later, some members of the team honestly believed that the work had taken six months, not one.

By the time they had finished, their plan was enormously detailed. They had worked out most of the design for the IMPs, using an existing computer from the Honeywell company. They described how the network could be made to work even under heavy loads. And they also discovered that they could make the system run ten times more quickly than ARPA was asking.

Frank Heart's team started work at the beginning of 1969, and the job had to be finished by 1 September. No one today knows why BBN was given so little time to build the ARPAnet.

The ARPAnet was the first computer network. Soon it would become the heart of a network of networks - the Internet.









In 1958, President Eisenhower established ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) to oversee high-technology government projects. ARPA initially focused on military research, but in the 1960s, it began to invest heavily in computing. Bob Taylor, who led ARPA's computer projects starting in 1966, recognized that computers could do more than just calculationsâ€”they could communicate. He enlisted Larry Roberts to manage the creation of a computer network.

Roberts faced significant challenges in building the network, as at the time, no one knew how to connect computers in a meaningful way. In 1967, after a conference in Ann Arbor, Roberts refined his ideas and proposed a design using smaller computers, called IMPs, to facilitate communication between the larger host computers. However, the technical details, especially how the IMPs would communicate, were still unclear.

In the same year, Roberts encountered the concept of packet switching at a conference in Tennessee. Packet switching, which breaks messages into smaller packets that can travel independently through a network, seemed perfect for ARPAnet. This method of communication would allow the network to send data more efficiently and flexibly.

Roberts then turned to Frank Heart at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) to build the ARPAnet. Despite skepticism from major companies like IBM and AT&T, Heart's team at BBN, who were familiar with the project from previous work at Lincoln Laboratory, quickly developed a detailed plan. They managed to build the network and make it run far faster than initially expected.

In 1969, ARPAnet became the first operational packet-switched network, setting the stage for the development of the modern Internet.
